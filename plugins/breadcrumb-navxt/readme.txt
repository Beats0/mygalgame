Breadcrumb NavXT, the successor to the popular WordPress plugin Breadcrumb Navigation XT, was written from the ground up to be better than its ancestor. This plugin generates locational breadcrumb trails for your WordPress powered blog or website. These breadcrumb trails are highly customizable to suit the needs of just about any website running WordPress. The Administrative interface makes setting options easy, while a direct class access is available for theme developers and more adventurous users.

Breadcrumb NavXT now supports WordPress.org language packs. Want to translate Breadcrumb NavXT? Visit [Breadcrumb NavXT's WordPress.org translation project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/breadcrumb-navxt/).

== Installation ==
Open the appropriate file for your theme (typically header.php). This can be done within WordPress’ administration panel through Presentation > Theme Editor or through your favorite text editor. Place the following code where you want the breadcrumb trail to appear.
`if(function_exists('bcn_display'))
    {
        bcn_display();
    }`
Save the file (upload if applicable). Now you should have a breadcrumb trail on your WordPress powered site. To customize the breadcrumb trail you may edit the default values for the options in the administrative interface. This is located in your administration panel under Settings > Breadcrumb NavXT. See the [Calling the Breadcrumb Trail](http://mtekk.us/archives/guides/calling-the-breadcrumb-trail "Read more on calling the breadcrumb trail") article for more information on calling the breadcrumb trail.
